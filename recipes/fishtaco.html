        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>I came up with this recipe after having fish tacos from a street vendor in Ensenada, Mexico. It is the closest to authentic I have found. Salsa can be made a day in advance for flavors to blend.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canned diced jalapeno peppers, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>3 cups coleslaw mix</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ranch dressing</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 (9 ounce) box batter mix</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Mexican beer</li>
            <li>24 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
            <li>2 limes, sliced into wedges</li>
            <li>1 dash chile-garlic sauce (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, 1 tablespoon juice from jalapeno peppers, and garlic salt in a bowl; squeeze 1/2 lime over salsa fresca. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate while preparing fish.</li>
            <li>Toss coleslaw mix with ranch dressing in a bowl; set aside for flavors to blend.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir batter mix and beer together in a bowl. Wrap corn tortillas in wet paper towels and set aside.</li>
            <li>Dip cod in the batter mix; fry coated cod in batches in the hot oil until cod is cooked through and coating is brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove cod with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Microwave corn tortillas on high until warmed, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stack two tortillas on a plate; top with fish, a sprinkle of Mexican cheese, coleslaw mixture, salsa fresca, and a squeeze from lime wedge. Drizzle with chile-garlic sauce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
