        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Alfredo Sauce is a rich, smooth and creamy white sauce perfect for serving with cooked pasta. Authentic Italian Alfredo sauce is typically made with Parmesan cheese, butter, some warm pasta cooking water, and salt. Over the years, itâ€™s been adapted to include heavy cream.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into large cubes or slices</li>

            <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the butter and cream to a large nonstick saute pan, over <strong>medium-low heat</strong>; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
            <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (<em>do not boil</em>) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>

            <li>Take off the heat and toss with cooked fettuccine noodles (or your favorite pasta.)</li>
            <li>(<em>If the sauce isn't quite thick enough, allow it to stand for 2-3 minutes before tossing with the pasta.</em>)</li>
